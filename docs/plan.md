# CSV Integration Implementation Plan

This document outlines the completed implementation for integrating 50 additional historical events from `dur2.csv` into the TimeTester game.

## Overview

Successfully integrated 50 historical events from CSV data, expanding the total event count from 15 to 65 events. The integration required schema expansion, data conversion, and component updates to support year-only date formats and BCE years.

## Completed Implementation

### Phase 1: Schema Design & Expansion ✅

**Expanded JSON schema** in `historicalEvents.json` to include:
- `startYear`: number (negative for BC, positive for AD)
- `endYear`: number (negative for BC, positive for AD)  
- `regions`: array of geographical regions
- `themes`: array of thematic categories
- `difficultyLevel`: number (1-10 scale for fine-grained difficulty)
- `wikipediaLink`: optional URL field
- `mnemonic`: optional memory aid field
- `duration`: calculated event duration in years

**Maintained backward compatibility** with existing fields:
- `startDate`/`endDate`: converted to string format for legacy components
- `difficulty`: mapped from numeric scale to easy/medium/hard

### Phase 2: Data Conversion ✅

**Created conversion script** (`scripts/convertCsvToJson.js`) that:
- Parses CSV with proper column alignment handling
- Uses `NumYearStart`/`NumYearEnd` columns directly (preserving negative values for BC)
- Maps boolean category columns to region/theme arrays
- Generates new IDs 16-65 (avoiding conflicts with existing 1-15)
- Handles missing data gracefully

**Data transformation results:**
- 50 events successfully converted
- Categories: Religion (9), Historical (24), Wars (3), Discovery (8), Science (4), Invention (1), Royalty (1)
- Regions: Africa (19), China (18), Asia (13), Britain (5), Russia (4), and others
- Difficulty distribution: Full range 1-10 with proper mapping to legacy system

### Phase 3: System Updates ✅

**Updated dateHelpers.js** with year-only support:
- `parseYear()`: handles negative years for BC dates
- `formatYear()`: displays BCE/CE appropriately  
- `calculateYearDuration()`: year-based duration calculations
- `getEventYears()`: unified interface for both old and new data formats
- `hasYearOnlyData()`: detects new vs legacy events

**Updated DateInput component**:
- Supports year range: -10000 to 2024
- Updated placeholders to show BCE examples
- Added user guidance for negative number input
- Maintains existing validation with expanded year range

**Updated scoring system**:
- Dual-mode scoring: year-based for new events, date-based for legacy
- Uses `getEventYears()` to automatically select appropriate calculation method
- Maintains identical scoring algorithm for consistency
- Backward compatible with existing 15 events

### Phase 4: Data Quality & Validation ✅

**Validation results:**
- All 50 events have valid start/end years
- Years range from -4500 BCE (Sumer) to 2005 CE (Second Congo War)
- Duration calculations verified (e.g., Sumer: 2600 years, Roman Empire: 503 years)
- No duplicate IDs or missing required fields

**Sample converted events:**
- Sumer (-4500 to -1900): 2600 years, Religion theme, difficulty 10/10
- Roman Empire (-27 to 476): 503 years, Science/World themes, difficulty 4/10
- World War II (1939 to 1945): 6 years, Discovery/World themes, difficulty 1/10

## Implementation Files

### New Files
- `scripts/convertCsvToJson.js`: Data conversion utility
- `docs/plan.md`: This implementation documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/data/historicalEvents.json`: Expanded from 15 to 65 events
- `src/utils/dateHelpers.js`: Added year-only functions
- `src/components/Game/DateInput.jsx`: BCE year support
- `src/utils/scoring.js`: Dual-mode scoring system

## Game Impact

**Enhanced Gameplay:**
- 4.3x more events (15 → 65 total)
- Spans ~7000 years of history (-4500 BCE to 2005 CE)
- Includes ancient civilizations, medieval periods, and modern conflicts
- Fine-grained difficulty levels (1-10) for better game progression

**Maintained Compatibility:**
- Existing 15 events unchanged and fully functional
- All existing game mechanics work seamlessly
- UI/UX remains consistent with BCE notation support

## Testing Notes

The implementation maintains full backward compatibility while adding robust support for ancient historical events with BCE dates. All components gracefully handle both old YYYY-MM-DD format events and new year-only format events.
